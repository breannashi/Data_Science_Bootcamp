        "As an enterprising bioinformatics researcher, you want to store your genetic data and metadata in a group. But in this notebook world, libraries like Seurat and ScanPy don't exist so you must come up with your own solution. Since you have a lot of cell barcodes (strings) and associated genetic sequences (also strings), you decide to build your own solution. Let's say you have 100 barcodes of length 15 and associated gene information strings of length 500. The barcodes all start with an uppercase letter and can have uppercase, lowercase, and digits. The genes are all strings of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'."

How do we store data in Python? How do we define behavior? You know the answers already but how do we group these together? More importantly, all bags are the same in a fundamental way so is there a way for us to define a template for a software object that defines fundamental behavior? Yes! It's called a \"class\".
